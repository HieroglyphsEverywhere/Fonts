# Hieroglyphs Everywhere Experimental Fonts

## Experimental fonts

Experimental fonts are provided free of charge to stimulate development and use of
Opentype fonts compatible with the current and upcoming versions of 
Egyptian Hieroglyphic in the Unicode standard.

These fonts are classed as experimental since changes and improvements can be expected during the next two or more years. Nevertheless they are useful for many purposes.
Major changes and additions will be announced on the
Hieroglyphs everywhere blog https://hieroglyphseverywhere.blogspot.co.uk/.

See the [AEFL license](License.md) for terms and conditions of use before downloading a 
font.

## Aaron hieroglyphic font series

The Aaron series of hieroglyphic fonts use solid glyphs rather than
the Hieroglyphica or Gardiner styles of outline font. <u>Aaron Alpha fonts do not implement quadrat shaping using the
proposed Hieroglyph formatting controls</u>.

### Aaron UMdC Alpha font

The **Aaron UMdC Alpha** font is UMdC version 1 compatible font (see [UMdC project](https://github.com/HieroglyphsEverywhere/UMdC)). This has
something of the chicken and the egg at present since the UMdC compatibility rules are
still being defined so its likely this will be updated from the current version (1.00). As well as the downloadable OpenType font file, there is
a web font WOFF version for website use. 

A sample UMdC transcription using the web font version
is online at [Westcar Papyrus](https://hieroglyphseverywhere.github.io/umdc.github.io/UMdCExamples/PapyrusWestcar.html).

Being a UMdC font, **Aaron UMdC Alpha** is compatible with Unicode 10 so can be used just like any
other current Unicode hieroglyphic font. I've made an effort to avoid various problems
apparent in other Unicode hieroglyphic fonts such as sizing and positioning of glyphs.
If you find bugs or have any suggestions for improvements let me know and I'll see what can be done for the next update.

### Aaron UMdC Alpha Phonetic font

The **Aaron UMdC Phonetic Alpha** font is a variation of the 
**Aaron UMdC Alpha** font that contains colour assignments 
to hieroglyphic ideograms.

In conjunction with text editors that suport polychromatic fonts, this
can be a useful aid to proofreading UMdC-encoded data.

### Aaron Basic RTL Alpha font

The **Aaron Basic RTL Alpha** font provides right facing hieroglyphs for RTL (Right to left text), 
primarily intended for use in documentation at this stage.
