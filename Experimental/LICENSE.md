# Aaron Experimental Font License 1.0

The Aaron Experimental Font License (AEFL) applies to fonts in the Aaron series of Experimental 
Egyptian Hieroglyphic fonts Copyright (c) Bob Richmond 2017.

The fonts are hosted at https://github.com/HieroglyphsEverywhere/Fonts/Experimental.


## Opentype fonts

  * **Aaron UMdC Alpha** (aaronumdcalpha100.ttf)
  * **Aaron UMdC Alpha web font** (aaronumdcalpha100.woff)

### Preamble

The aim of the AEFL is to stimulate development and use of
Opentype Egyptian Hieroglyphic fonts compatible with the Unicode standard.

There are two important technical issues to consider:

1. Crucial elements needed to support hieroglyphic writing are not yet available in the Unicode Standard nor supported in software that uses Unicode (although some elements are in the pipeline for possible 2019 release).
2. Hieroglyphic fonts typically contain thousands of glyphs and use advanced OpenType features to enable quadrat shaping making them probably the most complex fonts devised to date.

Once the status of Unicode hieroglyphic progresses sufficiently and
verification procedures become available to ensure a hieroglyphic
font is valid for purpose it will be possible to release fonts under 
standard font licenses. AEFL is used in the meantime to help avoid anarchy or malicious intent.

### Permissions and conditions

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font, to use, study, dissasemble, copy, merge, and modify copies of the
the font for personal or research purposes.

The unmodified Web font version of the font may be used on a web site so long as the name of the font is acknowledged.
