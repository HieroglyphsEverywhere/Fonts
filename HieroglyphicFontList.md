#### Aaron UMdC Alpha

The **Aaron UMdC Alpha** font contains all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs added to Unicode in 2009. In addition, characters required
for UMdC transcription of hieroglyphic are present,  including those used for Egyptian transliteration.
The new Quadrat formatting characters in the pipeline for a future version of
Unicode are also defined. See [UMDC project](https://github.com/HieroglyphsEverywhere/UMdC).

**Licensing:** [Aaron Experimental Font License (AEFL)](https://github.com/HieroglyphsEverywhere/Fonts/blob/master/Experimental/LICENSE.md).

#### Aaron Basic RTL Alpha

The **Aaron Basic RTL Alpha** font contains all characters from the UMdC Alpha font with
mirrored (right-facing) hieroglyphs as is necessary to display the characters in Right to Left writing 
direction. UMdC always works with Left to Right (LTR) text so at present this font is mainly only intended for documentation purposes.

**Licensing:** [Aaron Experimental Font License (AEFL)](https://github.com/HieroglyphsEverywhere/Fonts/blob/master/Experimental/LICENSE.md).


#### Aegyptus

The **Aegyptus** font contains all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs added to Unicode in 2009. 
The glyphs are inspired by the forms in the Hieroglyphica (2000) catalogue, themselves 
based on a line drawing style used for digital pen plotters in early developments
of digital hieroglyphic. A large number of additional hieroglyphs mostly from the Hieroglyphica catalogue are
provided in the Unicode Plane 15 private user area. Aside from hieroglyphs, a stylized collection of alphanumeric and punctuation characters are defined.

Along with Aegyptus, a subset standard-only font **Gardiner** is provided, without the Plane 15 additions.


**Licensing:** Free for any use.


#### Abydos

The **Abydos** font contains all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs added to Unicode in 2009.
It also covers material useful for work on proposals for encoding Egyptian Hieroglyphs in The Unicode Standard, with a total of
 7440 Egyptian Hieroglyphs in its database at version 1.78 (2017).

Its primary role at present is to support research into proposals to expand 
the hieroglyphic repertoire in the Unicode Standard.
 
**Licensing:** Free for any use.

#### JSesh font

The **JSesh font** contains all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs added to Unicode in 2009. These glyphs are
based on the glyph outlines used in the JSesh software. The font
does not contain glyphs for any other characters. From website:
 *basically, it's optimized to be used as a glyph source for a hieroglyphic word processor, not as a stand-alone font*.

The current downloadable version (1.0) does not contain any designer or licensing  information.

**Licensing:** Undefined.

#### NewGardiner

The **NewGardiner** font contains all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs added to Unicode in 2009. 
The glyph outlines were drawn by Mark-Jan Nederhof based on the glyph shapes used by Gardiner in his *Egyptian Grammar*.
The font does not contain glyphs for any other characters. 

**Licensing:** "Free for non-commercial use".

**Take care to download the NewGardinerSMP.ttf font from the website.** The NewGardiner.ttf file also available for download
uses the Unicode BMP private use area (following the EGPZ 1.0 code assignments used to develop the Unicode standard during 2005-2009).



#### Noto Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs

The **Noto Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs** font contains all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs added to Unicode in 2009. 
The glyphs outlines are by Monotype Imaging but Copyright Google Inc. The font does not contain glyphs for any other characters.

**Licensing:** Apache License, Version 2.0. (but apparently moving to OFL Open Font License 1.1).



#### Segoe UI Historic

Windows 10 fallback font for Historic scripts. 

**Licensing:**  Unclear, the font license URL embedded in the font refers to http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/.
